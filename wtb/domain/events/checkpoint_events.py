"""
Checkpoint-related domain events.

Published during checkpoint and rollback operations.

Updated 2026-01-15 (DDD Compliance):
- Uses CheckpointId value object instead of int
- Uses execution_id instead of session_id
- Removed tool_track_position (LangGraph doesn't track tools)
- Added proper domain event structure

Updated 2026-01-27 (Event Unification - HIGH-001):
- CheckpointEvent now has same interface as WTBEvent (event_id, timestamp, event_type)
- Consistent event handling across the system
- Frozen for immutability (checkpoint events should not be mutated)
