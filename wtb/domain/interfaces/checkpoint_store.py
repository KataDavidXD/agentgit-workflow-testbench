"""
Checkpoint Store Interface.

Infrastructure interface for checkpoint persistence.
NO BUSINESS LOGIC HERE - only save/load/list operations.

All checkpoint reasoning is in the domain (ExecutionHistory).

Design Philosophy:
==================
This follows the DDD principle of separating domain logic from infrastructure:
- Domain: ExecutionHistory contains business logic (get_rollback_target, etc.)
- Infrastructure: ICheckpointStore handles only persistence mechanics

Implementations:
- InMemoryCheckpointStore: For unit testing
- LangGraphCheckpointStore: Maps domain ↔ LangGraph StateSnapshot
