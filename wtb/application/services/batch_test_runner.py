"""
ThreadPool Batch Test Runner.

Local multithreaded implementation of IBatchTestRunner for development
and single-node execution.

Refactored (v1.7):
- Uses ExecutionControllerFactory for ACID-compliant isolated execution
- Each thread gets its own ExecutionController + UoW (Isolation)
- Removed placeholder _run_workflow_nodes() - actual execution via controller

SOLID Compliance:
- SRP: Orchestrates batch tests only, delegates execution to controller
- OCP: New execution strategies via factory
- DIP: Depends on factory callables, not concrete implementations

ACID Compliance:
- Atomicity: Each variant execution is atomic (UoW transaction)
- Consistency: Unified execution path via ExecutionController
- Isolation: Each thread has isolated UoW + StateAdapter
- Durability: Results persisted via UoW.commit()

Usage:
    from wtb.application.services.batch_test_runner import ThreadPoolBatchTestRunner
    from wtb.application.factories import ExecutionControllerFactory
    
    runner = ThreadPoolBatchTestRunner(
        controller_factory=ExecutionControllerFactory.get_factory_callable(config),
        max_workers=4,
    )
    
    result = runner.run_batch_test(batch_test)
